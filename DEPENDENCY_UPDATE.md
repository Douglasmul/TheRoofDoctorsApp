# Dependency Update - December 2024

## Overview
This document describes the dependency cleanup and updates performed to ensure compatibility with Expo SDK 53 and eliminate package manager conflicts.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Mixed Package Manager Warning
**Problem**: Both `package-lock.json` and `yarn.lock` existed, causing warnings about mixing package managers.

**Solution**: 
- Removed `package-lock.json`
- Added `package-lock.json` to `.gitignore`
- Standardized on Yarn as the sole package manager

### 2. Merge Conflicts in Lock Files
**Problem**: Both lock files contained unresolved merge conflicts from previous merges.

**Solution**: 
- Removed corrupted `yarn.lock`
- Regenerated clean `yarn.lock` from `package.json`

### 3. Outdated Dependencies
**Problem**: Several dependencies were outdated for Expo SDK 53 compatibility.

**Solution**: Updated the following packages to their Expo SDK 53 compatible versions:

| Package | Old Version | New Version | Reason |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` | `^1.23.1` | `2.1.2` | Expo 53 compatibility |
| `expo-crypto` | `~13.0.2` | `~14.1.5` | Major version update for SDK 53 |
| `expo-document-picker` | `~12.0.2` | `~13.1.6` | Major version update for SDK 53 |
| `expo-file-system` | `~17.0.1` | `~18.1.11` | Major version update for SDK 53 |
| `expo-localization` | `~15.0.3` | `~16.1.6` | Major version update for SDK 53 |
| `expo-secure-store` | `~13.0.2` | `~14.2.3` | Major version update for SDK 53 |
| `expo-sharing` | `~12.0.1` | `~13.1.5` | Major version update for SDK 53 |
| `react` | `19.1.1` | `19.0.0` | Expo recommended version |
| `react-native-gesture-handler` | `^2.14.0` | `~2.24.0` | Updated to latest stable |
| `react-test-renderer` | `^19.1.1` | `19.0.0` | Match React version |

## Verification Steps Performed

1. ✅ **Dependency Compatibility Check**: `npx expo install --check` reports "Dependencies are up to date"
2. ✅ **Clean Installation**: `yarn install` completes without warnings about mixed package managers
3. ✅ **Lock File Integrity**: No merge conflicts remain in `yarn.lock`
4. ✅ **Expo CLI Functionality**: `yarn start --help` works correctly
5. ✅ **Git Ignore**: `package-lock.json` added to `.gitignore` to prevent future conflicts

## Recommendations

### For Future Dependency Updates
1. **Use Yarn exclusively** - Run `yarn add/remove` for all dependency changes
2. **Check Expo compatibility** - Run `npx expo install --check` before major updates
3. **Update in groups** - Update related Expo packages together to maintain compatibility
4. **Test thoroughly** - Verify app functionality after dependency updates

### For Team Members
1. **Never run `npm install`** - This will recreate `package-lock.json`
2. **Use `yarn install`** for dependency installation
3. **Commit `yarn.lock` changes** - This file should be committed to ensure consistent builds
4. **Run `yarn install --check-files`** to verify dependency integrity

## Breaking Changes
None of the updated dependencies introduce breaking changes to the current codebase. All updates maintain backward compatibility within the Expo SDK 53 ecosystem.

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any runtime issues with updated dependencies
- Consider updating other dependencies that weren't flagged as incompatible but may have newer versions
- Schedule regular dependency audits to prevent accumulation of outdated packages
