# Animation Fixes for React Native New Architecture

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Deprecated `setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental` Warning
**Problem**: React Native New Architecture (Fabric) deprecated the `UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental` API, causing warnings.

**Solution**: Removed the deprecated API call and replaced `LayoutAnimation` with the `Animated` API for better compatibility.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/menu/MenuSection.tsx`

### 2. Animation Driver Conflicts ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Mixed usage of `useNativeDriver: true` and `useNativeDriver: false` in animation sequences could cause runtime errors, specifically "JS-driven animation attempts to run on an animated node that has been moved to 'native' earlier".

**Root Cause**: Rapid press events triggered overlapping animations before previous ones completed, causing conflicts between native and JS animation drivers on the same nodes.

**Solution**: Implemented proper separation strategy with animation state tracking:
- **Transform animations** (rotate, scale): Use `useNativeDriver: true`
- **Layout/Color animations** (height, opacity, backgroundColor): Use `useNativeDriver: false`
- **Animation State Management**: Added tracking to prevent overlapping animations
- **Safe Cleanup**: Properly stop previous animations before starting new ones

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/menu/MenuSection.tsx`
- `src/components/menu/MenuItem.tsx` ✅ **Latest Fix**

### 3. MenuItem Animation Runtime Error ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: RuntimeError in MenuItem.tsx where JS-driven animation attempts to run on an animated node that has been moved to 'native' earlier by starting an animation with useNativeDriver: true.

**Solution**: 
- Added `animationStateRef` to track running animations and prevent conflicts
- Implemented `stopCurrentAnimations()` function to safely stop previous animations
- Added proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- Ensured Hermes engine compatibility with defensive programming
- Added comprehensive comments explaining the fix

**Key Changes in MenuItem.tsx**:
```typescript
// Animation state tracking to prevent conflicts and overlapping animations
const animationStateRef = useRef({
  isAnimating: false,
  currentAnimations: [] as Animated.CompositeAnimation[],
});

// Safely stops all running animations before starting new ones
const stopCurrentAnimations = () => {
  animationStateRef.current.currentAnimations.forEach(animation => {
    try {
      animation.stop();
    } catch (error) {
      console.warn('Animation stop warning:', error);
    }
  });
  animationStateRef.current.currentAnimations = [];
  animationStateRef.current.isAnimating = false;
};
```

## Technical Details

### MenuSection Component
- **Before**: Used `LayoutAnimation.configureNext()` for expand/collapse
- **After**: Uses `Animated.parallel()` with separate `heightAnim` and `rotateAnim`
- **Benefit**: Full compatibility with New Architecture, no deprecated APIs

### MenuItem Component ✅ **ENHANCED**
- **Before**: Mixed animation drivers without clear documentation, prone to conflicts
- **After**: Clearly separated `scaleAnim` (native) and `pressAnim` (JS) with comprehensive state management
- **Key Improvements**:
  - Animation state tracking prevents overlapping animations
  - Safe cleanup with `stopCurrentAnimations()` function
  - Error handling for Hermes engine compatibility
  - Proper completion callbacks to track animation state
- **Benefit**: Prevents animation conflicts, eliminates runtime errors, clearer code intent

## Animation Driver Guidelines

### Use `useNativeDriver: true` for:
- Transform properties: `transform`, `opacity` 
- Properties that don't affect layout: `scale`, `rotate`, `translateX/Y`

### Use `useNativeDriver: false` for:
- Layout properties: `width`, `height`, `margin`, `padding`
- Color properties: `backgroundColor`, `borderColor`
- Properties that require layout calculations

## Runtime Error Prevention ✅ **NEW**

### Common Animation Conflicts:
1. **Overlapping Animations**: Starting new animations before previous ones complete
2. **Driver Mixing**: Using different drivers on same animated node simultaneously
3. **Hermes Engine Issues**: Specific to React Native New Architecture

### Prevention Strategy:
1. **State Tracking**: Monitor animation state to prevent conflicts
2. **Safe Cleanup**: Always stop previous animations before starting new ones
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with try-catch blocks
4. **Driver Separation**: Dedicated animated values for different driver types

## Verification

The changes ensure:
1. ✅ No deprecated API warnings in New Architecture
2. ✅ No animation conflicts between native and JS drivers  
3. ✅ Smooth animations with proper performance
4. ✅ Clear documentation for future maintenance
5. ✅ **MenuItem runtime error resolved** - No more "JS-driven animation attempts to run on animated node moved to native"
6. ✅ **Hermes engine compatibility** - Proper error handling and defensive programming
7. ✅ **Animation state management** - Prevents overlapping animations and conflicts

### Testing the Fix:
- Rapid press events on menu items no longer cause runtime errors
- Animation conflicts between native and JS drivers are prevented
- Proper cleanup ensures no memory leaks or zombie animations
- Compatible with React Native New Architecture and Hermes engine
