# Prune: Non-Roofing Files Removal Summary

## Overview

This PR removes files from the main repository tree that do not contain roofing-related business logic, keywords, or functionality. The goal is to clean up the repository structure to keep only roofing-related source code and assets in their original locations.

## Rationale

The repository was scanned for files containing roofing-related keywords (case-insensitive):
- roof, roofing, quote, estimate, measurement, measure, pitch
- AR, RoofMeasurement, QuoteService, customer, client, shingle  
- gutter, leak, inspection, material, scraps, waste factor
- invoice, contractor, job, property, roofdoctors, roofingco

Files that did not contain any of these keywords in their content or filenames were candidates for removal.

## Conservative Approach Taken

After analysis, only clearly non-essential files were moved to maintain application stability:

### Files Moved to Archive (1 file):
- `App.js` - Empty file (0 bytes), redundant with `App.tsx`

### Files Identified But NOT Moved (Safety):
- `babel.config.js` - Build configuration (essential)
- `index.js` - React Native entry point (essential) 
- `index.ts` - TypeScript entry point (essential)
- `jest.config.js` - Test configuration (essential)
- `assets/*.png` - App icons and splash screens (referenced in app.json)
- `src/__tests__/CompanySettingsService.test.ts` - Tests company functionality (business-related)

## Testing Results

Before changes:
```
Test Suites: 15 failed, 9 passed, 24 total
Tests:       16 failed, 98 passed, 114 total
```

After changes:
- Build status: âœ… No new build errors introduced
- Test status: No changes to test results (only empty file removed)

## File Preservation

All moved files are preserved in `archive-non-roofing/` with complete directory structure. This is a fully reversible operation:

- Files can be restored using git or manual mv commands
- No data was permanently deleted
- Archive includes restoration instructions

## Next Steps

1. **Review**: Verify that only appropriate files were moved
2. **Optional**: Additional cleanup can be done in follow-up PRs if desired
3. **Future**: The archive can be permanently deleted if no longer needed

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**: Only one empty redundant file was moved. All essential configuration, source code, assets, and tests remain in place.
