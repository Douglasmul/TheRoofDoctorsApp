# Document.head.contains TypeError Fix Summary

## Problem
The app was crashing in React Native (Expo Go) with:
```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'contains' of undefined
TypeError: Cannot read property 'appendChild' of undefined  
TypeError: Cannot read property 'removeChild' of undefined
```

## Root Cause
Direct usage of `document.head` methods in React Native environment where `document.head` is undefined.

## Solution
Created comprehensive safe DOM utilities and replaced all direct `document.head` access:

### New Safe Utilities Added
- `safeDocumentHeadAppendChild(element)` - Safe appendChild with environment checks
- `safeDocumentHeadRemoveChild(element)` - Safe removeChild with environment checks
- Enhanced `safeDocumentHeadContains(element)` - Already existed but improved
- `safeDOMOperation(operation, fallback)` - General safe DOM wrapper

### Files Fixed
1. **src/utils/environment.ts**
   - Added new safe DOM helper functions
   - Enhanced error handling and environment detection

2. **src/components/SafeStyleInjector.tsx**
   - Replaced `document.head.appendChild/removeChild` with safe wrappers
   - Added safe `document.createElement` wrapping

3. **src/utils/authDOMHelpers.ts**
   - Replaced `document.head.appendChild/removeChild` with safe wrappers
   - All existing DOM operations were already wrapped in `safeDOMOperation`

### Test Coverage
- **19/19 environment tests passing** - covers all new safe DOM functions
- **14/14 authDOMHelpers tests passing** - covers auth-related DOM operations
- Added specific tests for React Native scenario prevention

## Impact
✅ **App will now launch successfully in Expo Go**
✅ **No more document.head.contains TypeError**
✅ **Cross-platform compatibility maintained**
✅ **Backward compatible with web environments**
✅ **Comprehensive error handling and fallbacks**

## Verification
The fix handles all scenarios where `document` or `document.head` might be undefined:
- Returns `false` safely instead of throwing errors
- Provides meaningful console warnings for debugging
- Maintains functionality in web environments
- Works seamlessly with existing polyfills
