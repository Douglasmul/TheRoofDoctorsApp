## ðŸ“± UI Features Implemented

### Visual Feedback
- âœ… Color-coded surface types (Main=Green, Dormer=Orange, Hip=Pink, etc.)
- âœ… Numbered point markers with confidence indicators
- âœ… Real-time area calculation display
- âœ… Progress statistics (surfaces measured, total area)

### Interaction Features
- âœ… Touch to select points on camera view
- âœ… Drag-and-drop point editing
- âœ… Haptic feedback on point selection
- âœ… Visual crosshair for targeting
- âœ… Point removal and repositioning

### Validation & Error Handling
- âœ… Minimum 3 points required per surface
- âœ… Point boundary validation

## ðŸ”— Integration Points

### Quote Workflow
- âœ… "Start Manual Measurement" button in quote form
- âœ… Seamless navigation from quote to measurement
- âœ… Measurement data saves directly to quote

### Existing Systems
- âœ… Uses same `RoofMeasurementEngine` for calculations
- âœ… Compatible with existing `MeasurementReviewScreen`
- âœ… Same data types as AR measurement system

## ðŸ“Š Data Structure

### Manual Measurement Session
```typescript
interface ManualMeasurementSession {
  id: string;
  startTime: Date;
  currentSurface: Partial<RoofPlane> | null;
  completedSurfaces: RoofPlane[];
  selectedPoints: ARPoint[];
  mode: 'selecting_type' | 'selecting_points' | 'reviewing_surface' | 'complete';
}
```

### Point Selection with Visual Data
```typescript
interface SelectedPoint extends ARPoint {
  id: string;
  screenX: number; // For UI positioning
  screenY: number; // For UI positioning
  isEditing?: boolean;
}
```

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Design Features

### Surface Type Selection
- Modal overlay with scrollable list
- Color-coded surface types
- Descriptive labels for each type
- Cancel/back navigation

### Point Selection Camera
- Full-screen camera view
- Overlay controls and feedback
- Numbered markers for points
- Real-time instructions
- Edit mode with drag handles

### Progress Tracking
- Visual progress cards
- Statistics display
- Surface list with details
- Action buttons for workflow control

## âœ… Requirements Fulfilled

1. **âœ… Support manual point selection for measuring any roof section** - Implemented with touch-based point selection
2. **âœ… Clear UI feedback for each point** - Numbered markers with visual feedback
3. **âœ… Allow editing or adjustment of selected points** - Drag-and-drop editing capability
4. **âœ… Display unique, accurate measurements for every surface** - Surface-specific measurements with type/material
5. **âœ… Enable saving measurements directly to quote section** - Direct integration with quote workflow
6. **âœ… Validate measurement data before saving** - Uses existing measurement engine validation
7. **âœ… Ensure integration with quote pages** - Seamless quote integration
